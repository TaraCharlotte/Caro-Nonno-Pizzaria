For the dough, early in the day, mix together the two flours in a large bowl along with the white wine, yeast, salt, and olive oil.
Slowly add in the warm water, stirring as you go until the dough comes together in a ball.
Dump the ball out onto a lightly floured surface and using your hands, knead with your hands until the dough is very smooth, about 5 to 7 minutes.
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl covered with plastic wrap and let double in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
Divide the dough up into 8 ounce portions, rolling each in a ball.
Place two of the balls on a lightly oiled plate and cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. (Dough can be made up to 48 hours ahead of time)
Wrap the extra remaining dough in plastic wrap and freeze for future use.
Remove the dough balls from the refrigerator 2 1/2 hours before needed, allowing them to completely come to room temperature before using.
Preheat your oven to the highest setting (usually 500 degrees F.).
For Each Pizza: On a lightly floured surface, use your hands to press your dough out to a 12 inch circle.

Lightly cover a baking sheet (or pizza peel if using a pizza stone) with cornmeal, and place the dough on top.
Lightly brush the outer edges of the pizza with olive oil, and spread the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border.
Scatter the mozzarella cheese over each pizza, leaving that 1 inch border clear.
Arrange half the anchovies and capers over each pizza.
Sprinkle the oregano, chili flakes (if using) and sea salt over the pizzas, then bake each pizza until bubbly and golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Slice & enjoy!
